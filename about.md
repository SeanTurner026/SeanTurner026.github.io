In my previous career in finance operations, I devoted study outside of work to learn Python in order to automate tasks for my department. Thrilled with the results, the only option was to continue learning. Eventually, I became aware of my interest in data science, and decided to quit my job and take the Data Science Immersive Course at General Assembly in order to fully pursue that passion. In the process, I also moved across the world because I find that I grow the most as a human being when faced with the unfamiliar.
