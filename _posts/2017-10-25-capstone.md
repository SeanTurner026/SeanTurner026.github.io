title: Using Zomato.com Reviews and NLP to Find Good Mexican Food
---

Ever since moving to Melbourne from New York, I have been keenly aware of the lack of good Mexican food in Australia. Overtime, this encouraged me to try and find the best Mexican food by webscraping Zomato.com for every review of Mexican restaurants in Melbourne that I could find.

In the end, I was able to scrape about 6,700 reviews. Unfortunately, I found that almost 3,500 reviews did not have numerical review scores. Instead, as a result of Zomato purchasing Urbanspoon.com in 2015, these review ratings consisted of a sentiment, positive or negative. Zomato encourages former Urbanspoon users to update their sentiment reviews to reflect a numerical score, but this doesn't appear to be happening.
