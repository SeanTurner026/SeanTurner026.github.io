# Analysing the Ames Housing Market

Using a dataset from kaggle.com, I analysed the Ames Housing Market. The purpose of this project was threefold:

1. Estimating the value of homes from fixed characteristics.
2. Determine any value of changeable property characteristics unexplained by the fixed ones.
3. Determine which property characteristics predict an "abnormal" sale.
