title: What Predicts the Best Data Science Salaries?
---

Using the job search aggregator Seek.com, I scrapped over 1,000 data jobs from Melbourne and Sydney. The resulting datasets were combined, cleaned and stored in a pandas DataFrame, which I used to identify what features are the best predictor of salary, and classify data science jobs.

Classifying data science jobs involved using Sklearns term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency (TFIDF) vectorizer to turn each word from the job posting text into a feature. I then used Sklearn's Bagging Classifier with the Gradient Boosting Classifier, and was able to correctly classify data science jobs 88% of the time, and used a random forest model to identify the best and worse predicting words.

Predicting data science salaries was a little less straight forward. While preforming EDA I noticed that senior level jobs in Melbourne are more positively skewed than in Sydney.

Taking this into consideration, I decided to use location (Sydney and Melbourne), seniority level, a length of the job description, and a tfidf vectorization of the description text as my features. This time I z-scored the non-tfidf features, and was able to explain 0.71% of the variance in job salary using Bagging Regression with Gradient Boosting Regression.
